### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Heya, I'm Igors (Igor) Dubanevics!

I'm a Computational Physicist looking for new projects I can apply my technical and artistic skills. I´m based in Riga, Latvia.

During my university studies, I gradually transitioned from Chemistry to Physics and, since 2020, I've been working with [scientific code](https://github.com/igordub/ddpt). Besides immersing myself in many different works and projects, I actively learn music and singing 🎤.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently, I'm improving my code design skills with a focus on reproducibility.<br />
BTW, if you´re looking for a scientific template for a CompBioPhys based project, take a look at this [Computational Biophysics project template that I created](https://github.com/igordub/comp-biophys-research-project).
